# Notes 
gem install corneal 
Provides generators that we can use to make a new sinatra app 
After we have a Sinatra App, corneal can be used to make a new model or a new controller or both including a migration 
Also it adds things that need to be in the config.ru file so the controller we have created gets loaded 
Makes it easier to build sinatra
